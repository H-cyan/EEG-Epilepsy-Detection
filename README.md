# EEG-Epilepsy-Detection
This is a project for Problem A of 2021 SYSU MCM.  In this project, we try to figure out the differences between normal people's EEG (Electroencephalogram) and the EEG of patients with epilepsy as well as hope to build effective classifiers to automatically discern the epileptiform EEG.
